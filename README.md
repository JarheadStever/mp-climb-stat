# mp-climb-stat

- This web application pulls JSON "ticks" data from Mountain Project in order to show more in-depth and customizable data about the climbs you've done. 

- Future feature additions include: 
  - searching for your user account
  - selecting custom metrics to graph
  - switching between all climbs you've done/attempted and climbs you've sent
